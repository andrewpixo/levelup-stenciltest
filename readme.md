## Overview

This is a proof of concept of creating web components with the Stencil library, and integrating them into a React project, including passing event callbacks to the React project.

## To Run this Project:

 1. Install dependencies for the stencil project
`
   cd stencil-project`
`
    npm i
    `
 2. Build stencil project
    `
    npm run build
    `
 3. Install dependencies for the react project
    `
    cd react-project`
    `npm i
    `
 4. Start the react project
    `
    npm start
    `
